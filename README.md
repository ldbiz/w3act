### Install instructions

Please refer to the installation instructions of associated tool.

#### Whois
In order to install Whois lookup functionality:

Download JRuby JARs from [download-whois].
Extract ZIP and in folder jruby-1.7.9 execute:

gem install whois

in order to download whois gem for JRuby.

Then copy JRuby JARs to the "lib" folder of the project. We need jruby.jar and jruby-complete-1.7.9.jar.
Download [ukwa-whois] maven project. Compile it using command

mvn clean install

Create JAR package

mvn package

Copy generated project to the "lib" folder of the project. We will get a jruby-whois-3.4.2.2-SNAPSHOT.jar

## To use the application in production mode:

### Configuration details

The configuration file prod.conf for production should include necessary database entries for PostgreSQL or import them from application.conf:

#### For H2
db.default.driver=org.h2.Driver
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1"

#### For PostgreSQL
db.default.driver=org.postgresql.Driver

To create database 'w3actprod' with user 'training'
db.default.url="postgres://training:(password)@127.0.0.1/w3actprod"

In order to add and activate Travis CI application profile please add a new configuration file: conf/travis-ci.conf
This file overrides the default application.conf database (PostgreSQL) with the H2 one.
Then edit .travis.yml to pass the new config to play, i.e. change this line:
script: play-${PLAY_VERSION}/play test
to this
script: play-${PLAY_VERSION}/play -Dconfig.file=conf/travis-ci.conf test

### Open terminal and execute the following command:

play clean stage

This command creates BAT file for Windows or SH file for Linux that can be started then. 

Note that if you want to use "play start" instead that could cause a problem with not killed PIDs if you close application. 
Also RUNNING_PID file will be created in root directory of the project that should be also removed then.

For the case you use application on Windows, in order to see processes you could use “tasklist” command. 
And for killing process with e.g. PID 1304 use “taskkill /pid 1304 /F” command.

### Execution steps for Linux
[RHEL installation] wiki describes exact commands with comments for deployment on Linux. 

## To use the application in development mode:

### Open DOS window and run the following command:

play run

### Start browser and use URL: 

localhost:9000/actdev/

## Testing

play test

## Documentation

Description of the domain object model and user flows can be find in [wiki]

Initial permissions and roles definition according to the requirements document is in initial-data.yml

### Develop

Build status is supported by Travis [build-status]

## Requirements

To build you require:

* Git client
* Java Developers Kit (e.g. JDK 6)
* Play Framework
* PostgreSQL database

For using the recommended IDE you require:

* Eclipse Kepler Service Release 1 with m2eclipse plugin [eclipse]

In order to setup Java project with W3ACT sources use command:

play eclipse

### Troubleshooting

**Getting SQL errors in browser**

To solve this problem adapt paths in clean up script according to your installation and execute it:

cleanup.bat

sometimes helps also:

play clean

or simply manually delete all "target" folders in your project

Help with submodules for W3ACT Source

```
$ git submodule init
$ git config -l
$ git submodule update

```

Running an Multi-service Integration Test
-----------------------------------------

If you place a copy of a recent W3ACT database dump to `integration-test/pgdump/w3act.pgdump` you should be able to use the provided Docker Compose file to build and run your development version. 

** NOTE that we cannot include a copy of the W3ACT database here as it contains personal information from third-parties! **

First setup the database:

```bash
# Run PostgreSQL in the background:
docker-compose up -d postgres
# To restore from the pgdump file
docker-compose up pg_restore
```

Then build and run your version of W3ACT:

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up w3act
```

Note that right now the Docker Compose setup does not include OutbackCDX, Wayback or pdftohtmlex, so some pages will render slowly (due to failing to talk to these services) as well as the parts that depend on these additional services not working.

If you are able to develop Play apps locally, rather than building the Docker image, you can run the application directly, but against the Dockerised database:

```
$ activator -Dconfig.file=conf/dev-on-docker.conf -Dlogger.file=conf/logger-debug.xml clean start
```


Using the API from Curl
-----------------------

Login, then download via the API:

    $ curl -c cookie.jar -i --data "email=user@example.org&password=PASS" https://localhost:9000/act/login
    $ curl -o 42.json -b cookie.jar https://localhost:9000/act/api/targets/42
